                <p>These training levels are designed to produce a dog that is three weeks short of a title in any
                    dogsport, or three weeks from learning the basics of any job. A dog that thinks, that eagerly goes
                    into new situations, that performs reliably, that is comfortable in public, a good traveler, capable
                    of giving full attention to the handler and working at any reasonable distance.

                    Please read the <a href="training-levels.html">INTRODUCTION</a> before you start working. Work these
                    behaviors in any order, but do
                    them all before going on to <a href="training-level-two.html">Level Two</a>.</p>

                                    <strong>DISCUSSION:</strong> If I could only ever play one game with a dog, this
                                    would be it. It's
                                    difficult to believe that one easy game can have so many amazing benefits. The Come
                                    Game teaches the dog to go to people (aside from the millions of times a day I call
                                    my dog, if I ever lose her, I'd rather see her living a long and happy life with
                                    someone else than creamed on the road because she was afraid to approach another
                                    person). It teaches her to go to the person who's actually calling her. It teaches
                                    her to leave treats that she knows are there. It teaches her to approach people
                                    looking down, rather than jumping up. It teaches her to sit to greet people. It
                                    teaches her anybody calling her is a great person to meet. It teaches children a
                                    useful and fun way to interact with a dog. This is a GREAT game!
                                </p>

                                    <strong>EASY BEGINNINGS:</strong> You can play this with any number of people, but
                                    for the sake of
                                    discussion, we'll talk about two. If you're in a room by yourselves, please play it
                                    off leash. If you're in a roomful of other dogs and people, or out in the park, one
                                    person can hold the end of a long line attached to the dog.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Stand a little bit apart – how far apart depends on the dog. If you pretty much
                                    think he'll come, stand maybe 15' apart. If you pretty much think he won't, stand 5'
                                    apart. Both people have treats and a clicker (or, if you're playing with a young
                                    child or stranger, you can click for both people). Person A calls the dog. Since
                                    we're JUST starting to teach the dog to come, DO NOT say the "C" word ("Come"), or
                                    use the dog's name. There are lots of other ways to call a dog – "Puppy, puppy,
                                    puppy!" or "Yo, doggy, doggy" – use your imagination.
                                    While Person A is calling the dog, Person B is looking UP at the ceiling. Why?
                                    Because even an untrained dog has difficulty moving away from a person who's staring
                                    at her.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So, Person A calls the dog. When the dog is partway to him, he clicks and drops a
                                    treat between his feet. Doesn't matter if it bounces, you'll get better as you go
                                    along. Dog eats treat. End of round 1.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Now Person A looks at the ceiling. I don't see a dog, I'm not interested in a dog.
                                    Person B looks at the dog and starts calling her. The dog doesn't want to leave
                                    Person A because Person A gave treats. LOOK AT THE CEILING. Person B keeps calling
                                    until he gets the dog to come toward him. When the dog is partway to him, he clicks
                                    and drops the treat between his feet. Dog eats treat, end of round 2.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Repeat these steps until the dog realizes that it is the OTHER person who has the
                                    next treat.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When the dog figures out the game, he'll eat the A treat and spin to run to get the
                                    B treat. NOW he understands!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>ADDING A CUE:</strong> The time to add a cue is when you're getting the
                                    behavior you want ON
                                    A VOLUNTEER BASIS. What this means is that you can say anything you want to get the
                                    dog to come to you, but do NOT say the "real" words you want to use for the rest of
                                    his life. For myself, I want the dog's name and "Come" to be her "real" come cues,
                                    so I don't use those when I'm teaching her this game.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Sooner or later, the dog will figure out what's going on, and will start
                                    anticipating that, after one treat, the other person will call her. Then she starts
                                    grabbing one treat and running for the next one. NOW she's volunteering the behavior
                                    you want, NOW you can start telling her what the real words are. So, as she's
                                    turning to come to the next treat, call out "Stitch!" or "Come!" or whatever word
                                    you want to use.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There's a real benefit here for kids. Dogs usually know that kids are pushovers,
                                    while mom and dad are involved in housetraining and other unfortunate events, so
                                    usually a dog will start volunteering to come to a child before the parents get the
                                    volunteer behavior. At that point, someone can say to the kid <em>
                                        "Wow, she must like
                                        you best! You're the very first person who can say 'Come' to her!"
                                    </em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When you say your cue as she's turning to volunteer a come, you aren't telling her
                                    what to do. She's already doing it. You're only telling her what it's called. "Oh,
                                    by the way, that thing you're doing? We're going to call it 'Come', OK?"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Play this game every day for a week, then sometime when she's not thinking about
                                    coming toward you, ask her to come. If she comes, YEE HAH! If she doesn't, that's
                                    OK. Play the game for another week. And of course if you play it periodically with
                                    her throughout her life, she'll ALWAYS have a reason to come when you call.

                                    <strong>CONTINUING EDUCATION:</strong> It's a game! Make better rules! Move further
                                    apart (think what
                                    great exercise a pup can get playing the Come Game long before she's able to walk
                                    down the street with a loose leash!). Go up and down stairs. Hide in different
                                    rooms. Inside the house and outside the house. Play with more people. Play with
                                    total strangers. Play with young people and old people and people wearing hats and
                                    nuns in habits and people with turbans and people in uniforms. Play by yourself by
                                    dropping one treat between your feet and tossing another way over THERE.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You can also change what happens when the dog arrives at your feet. If she comes all
                                    the way and you haven't clicked or dropped the treat yet, what's going to happen
                                    next? She's right in front of you, looking down. No treat. She'll probably look UP
                                    next, to see if you died, or forgot to click. Nose goes UP, tail goes DOWN, bingo,
                                    you have a sit. Or you could play so you have to touch her collar before the click
                                    happens. Or put her collar on and off.

                                    Not quite as handy a cue perhaps as Sit, but close to it, and the beginning of
                                    putting the dog over on her side for grooming and nail cutting. Not to mention that
                                    it's a major part of Go To Mat, a behavior which would probably keep half the year's
                                    total of dogs out of the Humane Society! Down is the easiest position cue for dogs
                                    to understand, so the easiest one to ask a puppy for when you just need her off your
                                    head and shoulders for a moment.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>EASY BEGINNINGS:</strong>
                                    This is an ideal behavior to capture. Even the most active dog lies down a billion
                                    times a day. If you're desperate to have the dog lie down (please, God, just let the
                                    kerflushinner puppy lie down for ONE MINUTE!), click when she does and toss a treat
                                    between her paws so she can eat it without having to get up. Continue to click and
                                    toss every few seconds while she's still lying down. If you're more interested in
                                    teaching the dog to lie down on cue (the two aren't mutually exclusive, you can
                                    start with one and switch to the other later on), click when she lies down and toss
                                    the treat slightly off to one side so she has to get up to get it. This puts her in
                                    a perfect position to offer you another down to get another treat.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You can also lure a Down, but that's easier to do when she already knows how to Sit.
                                    From a Sit, hold a treat in your hand, put it right up to her nose so she can nibble
                                    it a bit, then very slowly move it down and then forward. If she rises out of the
                                    Sit, you moved your treat too far forward and not enough down. You're aiming for a
                                    spot on the floor slightly in front of her front paws. For more information on
                                    how-to lure, see the Level One Sit.

                                    <strong>ADDING A CUE:</strong> When the dog is offering you the down that you want,
                                    clearly knowing
                                    that the offering will result in a click, you can begin to tell her the name of the
                                    behavior. Give your cue while she's giving you the behavior. When you've paired the
                                    behavior and the word a hundred times, try asking her for the behavior when she's
                                    not thinking of it. If you get it, click and treat. If you don't, that's OK, pair it
                                    another hundred times and try again.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>CONTINUING EDUCATION:</strong> Play with the behavior. Teach it from the
                                    beginning in
                                    different rooms, indoors and outdoors. Teach it in your car, on carpet and hard
                                    floors. Teach it with you standing, sitting, and lying down.

                                    if the dog has ever MET a kangaroo, or if the dog knows anything at all about
                                    retrieving. As you follow one behavior through all the Levels, I'm hoping it will

                                    dog can't jump on
                                    you if he's sitting. Can't get on the couch if he's sitting on the floor. Can't leap
                                    on visitors if he's sitting away from them. A behavior necessary to virtually every
                                    dog-sport, and a useful default behavior When in doubt, sister, Sit!

                                    <strong>EASY BEGINNINGS:</strong> Kids love to teach this behavior. It's a great one
                                    to lure. With a
                                    soft, nibble-able treat in your hand, put your hand right on the dog's nose. Give
                                    her a chance to take a little nibble of the treat, then slowly start moving it up
                                    and back. Be sure that her nose is coming UP – nose goes UP, butt goes DOWN. As soon
                                    as the butt hits the ground, click and treat.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Be careful with luring – lure with the treat maybe five times, then make the same
                                    gesture with your empty hand. If the dog follows your hand and sits, click and
                                    treat. If she doesn't, lure with the treat maybe twice more, and try it without
                                    again. You're trying to get rid of the treat in your hand as quickly as possible.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>ADDING A CUE:</strong> The nice thing about luring a behavior is that it
                                    automatically builds
                                    in a hand signal. After a couple of days' practice, a short sample of the same
                                    gesture which produced the Sit in the first place will tell her you want her to Sit.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you want a voice cue for the Sit as well, try to separate it from the gesture.
                                    Click the Sit often enough that she begins offering it to you without waiting for
                                    your gesture. When she's offering it, you can tell her what it's called – almost as
                                    if you're saying "Oh, by the way, that thing you're doing there? That's called
                                    'Sit'" Pair the word with her sitting a hundred times, then ask for the behavior
                                    when she's not thinking of it. If she responds correctly, click and treat. If she
                                    doesn't, never mind, pair it another hundred times and then try again.

                                    <strong>DISCUSSION:</strong> We taught the dog to stay away from your hand (Zen).
                                    Now we’re going to
                                    teach her the opposite - to touch your hand. There are an infinite number of things
                                    you can get a dog to do if he’ll follow your hand, including heeling, getting onto
                                    the scale at the vet’s, spinning, and jumping. It’s also the first step in
                                    retrieving. When I meet a new dog that's jumping all over me, wrestling me for
                                    treats, giggling and bumping and trying to knock me down, I teach her Zen first.
                                    Then he’s a little more balanced and we can start having a conversation. On the
                                    other hand, when I meet a new dog that is afraid of me, or that doesn’t feel
                                    confident enough to offer me much, the first thing I teach is Touch. It’s usually a
                                    very easy behavior for a beginner dog to learn, quick for the trainer to explain,
                                    and gives everyone a little more confidence. Also, if I have a dog that’s afraid of
                                    men, for example, I can make men look a lot less scary by magically changing them
                                    from monsters into objects to be Touched. Once the dog can manipulate something to
                                    get a treat, it’s hard to be afraid of it any more.

                                    <strong>EASY BEGINNINGS:</strong> The first cue for hand Zen is a closed fist
                                    signaling “Stay away
                                    from this hand!” Since you now want the dog to approach and touch your hand, be very
                                    careful that you aren’t showing her your fist. Put your fingertips and thumb
                                    together as if you’re holding a treat. Hold this imaginary treat out so the dog can
                                    sniff it. When he reaches forward to sniff, be ready, and click when her nose
                                    touches your fingertips. Give her the treat from your other hand, or drop it on the
                                    floor. Repeat. That’s all there is to it!

                                    <strong>ADDING A CUE:</strong> Common cues for Touch are “Touch”, “Bump”, or “Bop
                                    It”. Later you’ll
                                    be teaching her to touch things with her paw. When you’re looking for a nose-touch
                                    cue, remember that you’ll need a different paw-touch cue, so save something like
                                    “Punch” for later. When she’s reliably bopping your hand with her nose, tell her
                                    your cue word just as she’s making contact.

                                    nose-bopping, start
                                    moving your hand around. Put it below her nose so she has to stoop a little to reach
                                    it. Put it above her nose so she has to reach a bit. Put it left and right. Think
                                    about limbering up her neck while you’re figuring out where to put your hand next.
                                    Put your hand in front of her nose when she’s standing up. When she can handle that,
                                    put it WAY out in front of her so she has to take a step or two to reach it. Higher,
                                    farther, faster…

                                    <strong>DISCUSSION:</strong> "Zen", as we use the word in dog training, is so
                                    important as to be
                                    virtually the foundation of civilization. It means "self-control". An untrained dog
                                    is a dog with no self-control. She wants food; she eats food, whether that food is
                                    on the floor, on the counter, or in a toddler's hand. She wants to greet someone,
                                    she greets them, whether she has to pull her handler over to them with a tight leash
                                    or not, whether that person wants to be greeted or not, whether that person is on
                                    the other side of a busy street or not. An untrained handler tries to control the
                                    dog - to keep her off the counter and away from the toddler, to hold her back with
                                    the leash, to hold her down off people, and to physically keep her out of the
                                    street.

                                    A trained dog understands that the way to get what she wants is to control herself,
                                    and a trained handler knows that true control of an animal must come from the animal
                                    herself, not from the handler.
                                </p>

                                    The trained dog sees a person with food, and sits, because polite dogs get treats.
                                    She greets people with all four feet on the floor because standing dogs get petted.
                                    She makes sure the leash stays loose because tight leashes NEVER go in the direction
                                    a dog wants them to go. She comes when she's called because what the handler has for
                                    her is always better than what she could find by herself.

                                    What does this have to do with "Zen"? Simply that the way to get food out of the
                                    handler's hand is to stay away from the hand. The more the dog wants the food, the
                                    harder she has to pretend that she doesn't want it.

                                <p>
                                    The great thing about doggy Zen is that once the dog has learned enough of it, she
                                    starts to apply the principles of self-control to her entire life. She practices
                                    "leash Zen" by keeping the leash loose, "floor Zen" by ignoring bait on the floor in
                                    the show ring, and "table Zen" by sitting and "wishing" food off the table instead
                                    of jumping up to help herself.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>EASY BEGINNINGS:</strong> Appropriately, the easiest way to teach Zen to a
                                    dog is to do very
                                    little. Show the dog a treat, then fold the treat into your hand so it’s totally
                                    protected. There must be no part of the treat available to a questing tongue or
                                    prying teeth. Put your hand down in front of her at mouth height. Note that your
                                    hand protecting the treat is a fist. This fist will be the dog’s first CUE. The fist
                                    cue says “Keep away from my hand.” Later you can change the cue if you want to, add
                                    a word that means the same thing, or change your hand appearance and position, but
                                    for now, your hand will always be in a fist when you’re talking to the dog about
                                    hand Zen.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Trying to protect the treat by holding it up above the dog's head, or jerking it out
                                    of her reach as she approaches it, are common mistakes. Holding it up high will only
                                    encourage her to jump up to get it, and jerking it away from her will force her to
                                    grab at it to try to get it away from you. You're already protecting it by holding
                                    it in your closed fist. Let Zen do its work. Let the dog figure out how to get that
                                    treat out of your quiet hand.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Pawing doesn't work. Mouthing doesn't work. Licking and gentle gnawing don't work.
                                    If the dog spends a long time working on your hand, trying to get that treat, great!
                                    Think of all that stamina and enthusiasm she's using to get what she wants! Once
                                    you’ve explained what's going to work, she'll use all that for you! If she sniffs
                                    briefly at your hand and then starts to lose interest, great! Your explanation will
                                    be short and easy!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So how DOES she get that treat out of your hand? She moves her nose away from your
                                    hand! Yep, that's all she has to do, just get tired of fussing with your hand and
                                    start to move away. What if she's actually leaving? What if she doesn't lick it at
                                    all? What if she moved away by accident? Who cares? We don't! There's only one
                                    question - did she move her nose away from your hand? If she did, click and open
                                    your hand so the treat drops to the floor.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That’s right, drop the treat on the floor. Don't just hand it to her. You can teach
                                    her Zen by handing her the treat, but the explanation is usually shorter and clearer
                                    when you drop it on the floor. "Don't touch my hand, now eat from my hand" can get a
                                    little confusing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That's all there is to Zen. Keep the treat safe from her until she moves away from
                                    your hand, click as she moves away, and drop the treat. Watch for the magic moment
                                    when she realizes how to make you drop the next treat.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>ADDING A CUE:</strong> Decide what word comes easily to you when you’re
                                    thinking about
                                    keeping the dog away from something. Common cues are “Off” and “Out”. “No” can be
                                    used, but most people have a very bad habit of bellowing “No!” at the dog when she’s
                                    shaking after a bath, when she’s chasing cats, when she’s barking at the sheep on
                                    TV, and when she’s drooling on the rug. What we’re looking for in a cue is clear
                                    information about what the dog should be doing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>CONTINUING EDUCATION:</strong> I particularly enjoy teaching Zen to very
                                    large adult dogs
                                    with owners who don't think the dog is smart enough to learn her own name. Within a
                                    couple of minutes, this "crazy stupid" dog can be sitting three feet back from a
                                    coffee table, staring intently at a delicious piece of liver resting all alone on
                                    the table. Once the owner sees that the fault lies in the explanations and not in
                                    the dog, we can start forging a real relationship.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When the dog is reliably staying away from your hand to make you click, you’ll
                                    notice that her “staying away” is getting harder, faster, longer. Pick one response,
                                    and shape it into something better. If you choose to work on distance, for instance,
                                    figure out how far she usually moves away from your hand (say, 6”). Click 6” and any
                                    response that moves her nose further from your hand than that. Don’t click any nose
                                    that is closer than 6”. In a little while, you’ll see that her usual distance has
                                    increased to 7”, so you start clicking 7” and beyond, and nothing closer.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Do the same for time. A rule I like to keep in my mind is “Ten times right, one time
                                    wrong”. If you click her for being successful at 3 seconds ten times in a row, you
                                    can afford to wait for 4 seconds one time. If she isn’t successful, well, you tried
                                    it and it didn’t work. Click her another 10 times at 3 seconds, then try for 4
                                    seconds again. If it doesn’t work, go for another 10 at 3 seconds. If it DOES work,
                                    continue clicking for 4 seconds until you get your 10 times right. When you have 10
                                    times right in a row at 4 seconds, try waiting for 5 seconds.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Ooh, now the TA DA part. When you’ve got some decent time and some decent distance,
                                    find a convenient coffee table. Show the treat to the dog, put the treat on the
                                    coffee table, and cover it with your hand. If you think this is going to be easy,
                                    think again. Staying away from your hand is NOT the same thing as staying away from
                                    the coffee table. Basically, you’ll be explaining Zen again right from the
                                    beginning. Maybe it’ll be so fast your head will spin. Maybe she’ll go right back to
                                    scratch and be trying to dig the treat out from under your hand. Both are normal.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So, treat on table, covered by your hand. Dog can’t get it by normal means. Sooner
                                    or later, by accident or deliberately, her nose moves away from your hand on the
                                    table. Click and flick the treat onto the floor. Yes, back on the floor again. You
                                    certainly don’t want to click and then let her eat the treat off the coffee table!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When she’s made the connection (oh, TABLE Zen! Now I get it!), live dangerously.
                                    Move your hand away from the treat. Of course, when you move your hand off it, she’s
                                    going to grab for it, so be ready to cover it again. Then, as she moves away (Duh!
                                    Don’t let mom sucker you into grabbing for it!), move your hand away again. Click
                                    and flick it off the table when she’s staying away from it. Build your time and
                                    distance until you can safely lean back away from the treat, leaving it totally
                                    available on the coffee table – except for the dog’s self-control. Wow, look what
                                    you guys just learned! When you can lean back and leave the treat alone, with the
                                    dog holding back waiting for you to click and flick it off the table, add your cue
                                    (Off, or Out, or whatever you decided on) as you’re placing the treat on the table.
                                    Use a lovely, quiet, trusting voice because that’s how you’re going to be speaking
                                    to your dog. Besides, it makes the control so much more impressive when you simply
                                    asked for it rather than bellowing and threatening!
                                </p>
