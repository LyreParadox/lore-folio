                <p>
                    In order to compete in obedience trials, a dog must learn to reliably sit, stand, down, stay in all
                    those positions for varying lengths of time, heel, and come. In order to compete in agility, a dog
                    must learn to weave, jump, go through tunnels, walk the dogwalk and the teeter. Herding, tracking,
                    drafting, Rally-O, schutzhund, conformation, water trials, flyball and scent hurdle races, retriever
                    trials, sledding, freestyle - every dog sport has its own set of required skills. Yet as I attend
                    competitions, training sessions and practice matches, I see again and again that the true failures
                    trainers and dogs have in these competitions is NOT so much in the skills written down in the rules
                    for that sport, but in the unspoken skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dogs arrive at the competition already exhausted from the car ride. They go all weekend without
                    relieving themselves. They lunge and snap at other dogs. They cower from loud and unusual noises.
                    They whine and fuss in their crates. They wander off in the middle of their performance to visit
                    other dogs, people, or bushes. They mat dive for lost treats. They pretend to do the work but
                    without any thought of teamwork. Or they perform brilliantly outside the ring and lose their minds
                    completely once they cross the threshold. Trainers and dogs go home frustrated and annoyed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "secret information" these trainers are lacking is this: a great competition dog requires THE
                    SAME skills as a great pet. How far a trainer goes toward perfecting those behaviors is entirely up
                    to him. Obviously a household pet doesn't require the same degree of training as a Service Dog.
                    Getting a first-level obedience title will not require the same amount of training as making the
                    National Finals in agility. The BASIC skills, however, are exactly the same, and that's what this
                    book is about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you've completed <a href="training-level-one.html">Level One</a>, you are starting to see that
                    you can communicate with your dog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <a href="training-level-three.html">Level Three</a> dog has most of the skills he'll need to make
                    a great pet. More to the point, you'll
                    have the skills you need to teach him any further skills specific to your own household.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By <a href="https://sue-eh.ca/2020/07/21/tl-leve-5-a/">Level Five</a>, you and your dog are really
                    communicating and already have most of
                    your traveling and
                    public skills as well as many of the behaviors which lead directly into specific skills required for
                    specific sports. You've done a lot of work on attention, teamwork, and duration of behaviors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://sue-eh.ca/2020/07/21/tl-level-6-a/">Level Six</a> and <a
                        href="https://sue-eh.ca/2020/07/21/tl-level-7-a/">Seven</a> – well,
                    now you're getting into elite competition
                    and public
                    access dogs. I'm
                    confident that a Level Six dog is a month away from ANY first-level competition title, because she
                    has ALL the unwritten behaviors and many of the written ones down pat. That month is for teaching
                    skills specific to the competition, but the important skills of <em> concentration, teamwork,
                        willingness
                        and ability to learn, looking for results, and understanding that to get what she wants she must
                        figure out what you want and give it to you </em> – these skills are already firmly installed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't take that "one month from a title" statement lightly. I've done a lot of testing on it.
                    Giant Schnauzers are large, passionate, German working dogs. Giant Schnauzer people tend to call
                    them "stubborn" and talk a lot about "staying on top of them", so they're naturally skeptical of
                    clicker training. At American Nationals they have "Games Day" where everyone brings their sport
                    equipment and everybody gets to try it. I arrived with a 6 year old Level Seven bitch (Song) for a
                    seminar I was booked to give, which practically nobody had signed up for (<em>
                        "Cookie pushing doesn't
                        work on Giants, you have to stay on top of them!
                    </em>"). At Games Day, I showed her a flyball box. I
                    clicked her for targeting the box with her paw. I clicked her for targeting the box with her paw and
                    tossed a ball at her as a reward. I told her she had to go over a jump to target the box, the ball
                    would jump out of the box, and then she had to bring the ball back to me over the jump in order to
                    get to do it again. Then two jumps, then three, then four. I taught her flyball in one 6-minute
                    session. At this point, people who competed in flyball started asking me what team she was on and
                    how many titles she had. Was she as well trained as a dog with flyball titles? Of course not. She'd
                    need a lot of practice to get really good at it. But at that point, she could have run on a team and
                    done the job. Six minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we moved on to the carts. This took longer. We worked for half an hour on the cart. At the end
                    of that time, she could do everything she needed to do except for two specific skills: confidently
                    starting a heavy load, and turning the sulky by sidestepping to the right. And she had a start on
                    those. Half an hour. Last year I taught my Level Six Portuguese Water Dog (Scuba) to do the
                    first-level Drafting Test in a week of light work. (Bear in mind, conditioning is another story).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we went to a field covered with large Rubbermaid containers for people to hide in for the dogs
                    to find. After ten minutes, the person in charge of the field said <em>
                        "Sue, if you're going to tell
                        people she doesn't do Search & Rescue or Tracking, try to make it look like she doesn't know how
                        to
                        do them, OK?"
                    </em> Ten minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the day, the seminar was booked solid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last summer Scuba earned the first-level herding title (TITLE, not Instinct Test) in three weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why are these things possible? Simply because the dog already knows we're a team. Already WANTS to
                    learn new things. Already understands self-control. And is comfortable with strange dogs, strange
                    people, strange equipment, and strange situations.

                                    I've chosen these behaviors as the important steps in making a dog a partner and
                                    team member. At later levels, the trainer can begin choosing specific channels
                                    leading to his own particular sports interests or, like me, work on them all to give
                                    the dog the greatest versatility:
                                </p>
                                <ul>

                                    <li><strong>Crate</strong> The dog learns to be confined at home, in the car, at the

                                        teach the dog and trainer to be creative, and to remind the trainer of why he
                                        got a dog in the first place.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Watch</strong> A concentration and duration behavior, difficult and
                                        important.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Zen</strong> The more the dog wants something, the harder he has to
                                        think about giving
                                        the trainer what SHE wants. A perfect explanation of life and training!</li>
