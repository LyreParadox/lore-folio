                <p>
                    In order to compete in obedience trials, a dog must learn to reliably sit, stand, down, stay in all
                    those positions for varying lengths of time, heel, and come. In order to compete in agility, a dog
                    must learn to weave, jump, go through tunnels, walk the dogwalk and the teeter. Herding, tracking,
                    drafting, Rally-O, schutzhund, conformation, water trials, flyball and scent hurdle races, retriever
                    trials, sledding, freestyle - every dog sport has its own set of required skills. Yet as I attend
                    competitions, training sessions and practice matches, I see again and again that the true failures
                    trainers and dogs have in these competitions is NOT so much in the skills written down in the rules
                    for that sport, but in the unspoken skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dogs arrive at the competition already exhausted from the car ride. They go all weekend without
                    relieving themselves. They lunge and snap at other dogs. They cower from loud and unusual noises.
                    They whine and fuss in their crates. They wander off in the middle of their performance to visit
                    other dogs, people, or bushes. They mat dive for lost treats. They pretend to do the work but
                    without any thought of teamwork. Or they perform brilliantly outside the ring and lose their minds
                    completely once they cross the threshold. Trainers and dogs go home frustrated and annoyed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "secret information" these trainers are lacking is this: a great competition dog requires THE
                    SAME skills as a great pet. How far a trainer goes toward perfecting those behaviors is entirely up
                    to him. Obviously a household pet doesn't require the same degree of training as a Service Dog.
                    Getting a first-level obedience title will not require the same amount of training as making the
                    National Finals in agility. The BASIC skills, however, are exactly the same, and that's what this
                    book is about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you've completed <a href="training-level-one.html">Level One</a>, you are starting to see that
                    you can communicate with your dog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <a href="training-level-three.html">Level Three</a> dog has most of the skills he'll need to make
                    a great pet. More to the point, you'll
                    have the skills you need to teach him any further skills specific to your own household.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By <a href="https://sue-eh.ca/2020/07/21/tl-leve-5-a/">Level Five</a>, you and your dog are really
                    communicating and already have most of
                    your traveling and
                    public skills as well as many of the behaviors which lead directly into specific skills required for
                    specific sports. You've done a lot of work on attention, teamwork, and duration of behaviors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://sue-eh.ca/2020/07/21/tl-level-6-a/">Level Six</a> and <a
                        href="https://sue-eh.ca/2020/07/21/tl-level-7-a/">Seven</a> – well,
                    now you're getting into elite competition
                    and public
                    access dogs. I'm
                    confident that a Level Six dog is a month away from ANY first-level competition title, because she
                    has ALL the unwritten behaviors and many of the written ones down pat. That month is for teaching
                    skills specific to the competition, but the important skills of <em> concentration, teamwork,
                        willingness
                        and ability to learn, looking for results, and understanding that to get what she wants she must
                        figure out what you want and give it to you </em> – these skills are already firmly installed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't take that "one month from a title" statement lightly. I've done a lot of testing on it.
                    Giant Schnauzers are large, passionate, German working dogs. Giant Schnauzer people tend to call
                    them "stubborn" and talk a lot about "staying on top of them", so they're naturally skeptical of
                    clicker training. At American Nationals they have "Games Day" where everyone brings their sport
                    equipment and everybody gets to try it. I arrived with a 6 year old Level Seven bitch (Song) for a
                    seminar I was booked to give, which practically nobody had signed up for (<em>
                        "Cookie pushing doesn't
                        work on Giants, you have to stay on top of them!
                    </em>"). At Games Day, I showed her a flyball box. I
                    clicked her for targeting the box with her paw. I clicked her for targeting the box with her paw and
                    tossed a ball at her as a reward. I told her she had to go over a jump to target the box, the ball
                    would jump out of the box, and then she had to bring the ball back to me over the jump in order to
                    get to do it again. Then two jumps, then three, then four. I taught her flyball in one 6-minute
                    session. At this point, people who competed in flyball started asking me what team she was on and
                    how many titles she had. Was she as well trained as a dog with flyball titles? Of course not. She'd
                    need a lot of practice to get really good at it. But at that point, she could have run on a team and
                    done the job. Six minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we moved on to the carts. This took longer. We worked for half an hour on the cart. At the end
                    of that time, she could do everything she needed to do except for two specific skills: confidently
                    starting a heavy load, and turning the sulky by sidestepping to the right. And she had a start on
                    those. Half an hour. Last year I taught my Level Six Portuguese Water Dog (Scuba) to do the
                    first-level Drafting Test in a week of light work. (Bear in mind, conditioning is another story).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we went to a field covered with large Rubbermaid containers for people to hide in for the dogs
                    to find. After ten minutes, the person in charge of the field said <em>
                        "Sue, if you're going to tell
                        people she doesn't do Search & Rescue or Tracking, try to make it look like she doesn't know how
                        to
                        do them, OK?"
                    </em> Ten minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the day, the seminar was booked solid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last summer Scuba earned the first-level herding title (TITLE, not Instinct Test) in three weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why are these things possible? Simply because the dog already knows we're a team. Already WANTS to
                    learn new things. Already understands self-control. And is comfortable with strange dogs, strange
                    people, strange equipment, and strange situations.

                                    I've chosen these behaviors as the important steps in making a dog a partner and
                                    team member. At later levels, the trainer can begin choosing specific channels
                                    leading to his own particular sports interests or, like me, work on them all to give
                                    the dog the greatest versatility:
                                </p>
                                <ul>

                                        dogs and people, to formal Recalls.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Contacts</strong> An agility skill with applications in many areas. You
                                        can stop the dog
                                        where you want, when you want.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Crate</strong> The dog learns to be confined at home, in the car, at the

                                        the crate willingly and stay in it – calm, quiet, and relaxed.</li>

                                        with the dog quietly and confidently out of the way.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Handling</strong> Manipulate the dog's body in any way, cut toenails,

                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Heel</strong> Total concentration and total position control.</li>

                                        in the theory
                                        behind the training.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Leash</strong> I'd call Loose Leash Walking the hardest thing we'll ever

                                            home</em>" is NOT

                                <p>The Levels are an example of "splitting". All the general things a dog needs to know
                                    are split into specific behaviors (like Sit and Target), and then split further into
                                    small chunks that, barring specific behavioral problems or disabilities, can be
                                    taught in a couple of weeks or months. The Levels are designed to give dogs and
                                    handlers a clear path to follow, a reminder of things that might be neglected in
                                    training, and a good cross-section of necessary skills. Each behavior starts easy,
                                    and gets more and more difficult as the team progresses through the Levels. Skill is
                                    based on skill, proficiency on proficiency.

                                    How long it takes each individual dog and trainer to get through a Level from
                                    scratch will depend on many things - the skill and experience of the trainer, the
                                    amount of time spent daily or weekly (or monthly) in actual training, whether time
                                    must be spent overcoming problems such as a lack of interest in food or previous
                                    training that the dog may have. When I designed the Levels, I was thinking that the
                                    average trainer and dog could average them out to about a Level every two to three
                                    months. My puppy and I, starting from scratch, have finished Level Three at five
                                    months of age (three months of training), but that was averaging about 8 hours a
                                    week of actual training time, and Level Four is going to take us longer than that.
                                    On the other hand, I have a student who is working through the Levels casually, when
                                    he feels like it. He's been working on Level Three for over a year now.

                                <p>There are three useful ways to get behavior.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>WAITING:</strong> Dogs don't sleep standing up. Even the most active puppy
                                    eventually lies down. Click it when it happens. <em>Advantage</em> – totally easy
                                    for the
                                    trainer and the only way to get behaviors like shaking and sneezing.
                                    <em>Disadvantage</em> –
                                    not useful for behaviors the dog doesn't naturally do. <em>Tip</em> – set yourself
                                    up for
                                    success. A wet dog is more likely to shake than a dry dog.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>LURING:</strong> Use a treat or a trained target to move the dog's head to
                                    get the behavior you want. Nose is lured up, tail goes down, voila, sit!
                                    <em>Advantage</em> – also easy for trainer and dog, the fastest way to get many
                                    behaviors, and most lures produce an automatic hand signal for the behavior.
                                    <em>Disadvantage</em> – if you use the lure too often, the dog will not perform the
                                    behavior without seeing the treat. Also gives the dog the option of deciding the
                                    behavior isn't worth the treat – such as going in a crate. <em>Tip</em> – get rid of
                                    the lure as quickly as you can.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>SHAPING:</strong> Break the behavior down into its tiniest parts and reward
                                    the dog for finding each part. <em>Advantage</em> – allows you to get behaviors you
                                    couldn't possibly get any other way, teaches dog and trainer to be creative,
                                    overcomes fear or reluctance by asking for tiny steps instead of huge lumps – "I'm
                                    not asking you to get in the crate, I'm only asking you to LOOK at the crate… "
                                    <em>Disadvantage</em> – tough to get started without someone to show you how.
                                    Requires the trainer to actually think. <em>Tip</em> - in the beginning, write out a
                                    list of at least ten steps for each behavior, and if you haven't shaped a behavior
                                    before, start with something that isn't important to you (get the dog to roll over,
                                    or spin, rather than heeling or weave poles) so you can get frustrated but not
                                    hysterical.
                                </p>

                                    In actual training, these three methods are rarely isolated. Training involves the
                                    artful combination of all three methods into an explanation your dog can easily
                                    understand.

                                    The click tells the dog that she did what you wanted. You go to work, at the end of
                                    the week you get paid. The dog goes to work, when she hears the click, she gets
                                    paid. EVERY CLICK IS FOLLOWED BY A TREAT. Click MEANS treat. It doesn't have to
                                    always be a food treat – it could be a toy, a good scratch, a tug, throwing the
                                    ball, a door opening, or
                                    anything else she wants. For ease of delivery and developing a flow of training,
                                    though, food will be your primary "weapon".
                                </p>

                                    Another important part of clicker training is that THE CLICK ENDS THE BEHAVIOR. If
                                    you're asking for a 10-second Sit-Stay and you click at the end of ten seconds, THE
                                    BEHAVIOR IS OVER. If the dog stays where she is while you deliver the treat to her,
                                    that's fine, but if she gets up and comes to you to get it, that's fine too. If you
                                    want to work on returning around behind her to heel position, you'll be clicking
                                    when you're behind her, or not until you're back in position. The click ends the
                                    behavior.

                                    It's not easy to decide when to ask the dog for more. She's doing a 5-second
                                    Down-Stay – hurray, who would have imagined this little bumblebee of a puppy would
                                    ever actually stay in one spot for 5 seconds? But now what? Do you go on practicing
                                    5-second Stays forever, or what?
                                </p>

                                    <strong>80% RIGHT</strong> There are three ways to measure success. The first is
                                    from the Baileys. When you've
                                    got 80% success, ask for more. So if you practice ten 5-second Down-Stays and she
                                    gets 6 of them right, that's only 60%. You need to practice more at that level (or
                                    less if it's really ugly). When she gets 9 right, that's 90%, you can move on to a
                                    6-second Down-Stay.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>TEN TIMES RIGHT, ONE TIME WRONG</strong> The second is mine. When she can
                                    give you ten right, you can risk letting her get
                                    one wrong. So, when she gives you a 5-second Down-Stay ten times, you can push the
                                    envelope and ask for 6 seconds. In reality, this is pretty much like Baileys'
                                    because most people wind up doing eight instead of ten anyway.

                                    Peck Stays, or whatever). Starting from scratch, ask for a 1-second Down-Stay. C/T.
                                    Then 2 seconds. Then 3 seconds. Then 4 seconds. Then 5 seconds. Then 6 seconds. Then
                                    7 oops, she broke. GO BACK TO ONE SECOND, start again and build back up. The dog
                                    herself will tell you where her threshold of understanding is, and when she's moved
                                    it. And if you think about it, this is really the same as the other two. When you're
                                    working on a 10-second Down-Stay, you'll be doing ten c/t before you ask for 11. And
                                    when you get up to times when going up in one-second intervals isn't necessary (352
                                    seconds, 353 seconds… ) you can start increasing in 5 or 10 second intervals. Let
                                    the dog tell you when.

                                    Dogs are superstitious animals. They watch very carefully for one thing to predict
                                    another. The sound of the refrigerator opening predicts food. The sound of the car
                                    pulling into the driveway predicts the owner entering the house. They learn
                                    predictors that we're not even aware of giving. When I'm getting ready to go out my
                                    dog has no obvious way of telling whether I'm planning on taking her with me or not,
                                    but if I'm taking her, she'll be jumping and wagging around the door, and if I'm
                                    leaving her behind, she'll be ready to get in her crate.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    No wonder, then, that they learn cues no matter how sloppy we are when explaining
                                    them.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For our purposes, though, the dog will learn more accurate responses to your cues if
                                    you introduce them correctly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When you first explain a behavior, say nothing. Let the dog concentrate on learning
                                    what you want. Get the behavior first. Then wait for the dog to offer you the
                                    behavior on her own. Once you can predict that you'll get the behavior you want,
                                    just the way you want it, you can start using it WHEN THE DOG IS GIVING YOU THE
                                    BEHAVIOR. You're not using the word to tell the dog to do something, you're merely
                                    saying the word so she can associate the word with the behavior she's offering you.
                                    Do that enough times, then test her understanding by saying the word and see how she
                                    responds. If she hears the word and gives you the behavior ("Wait, wait, 'Sit' means
                                    fold up my back legs, right?"), great, click and treat. If she hears the word and
                                    does nothing or gives you a different behavior, go back to pairing the word with the
                                    offered behavior for another few days.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And of course, once you have the cue attached to the behavior you want, use the cue
                                    to get the behavior. If you use the cue and DO NOT get the behavior – well, in my
                                    book, once is a fluke. Twice is a problem. When you find yourself repeating a cue,
                                    or you cue a behavior and get something else or something even slightly not-right,
                                    STOP USING THE CUE! Go back, retrain the behavior, reattach the cue, and go on from
                                    there.

                                    No matter what the problem you're having is, there are three areas to look at to
                                    find a solution.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The first is <strong>Criteria</strong>. Criteria is what you're expecting from the
                                    dog. Poor trainers
                                    ask for a lot in one lump. For some reason, this is called "lumping". Lumpers look
                                    for a complete, perfect behavior from the beginning. They want to tell a dog to
                                    stay, toss a dumbbell across the room, tell him to get it, have him bring it back
                                    and sit perfectly straight in front of them, hand it to them, then return on command
                                    to heel position. That's a big lump. And if something goes wrong with part of that
                                    lump, it's very difficult to fix it, buried as it is in the middle of the lump.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Great trainers, on the other hand, split behaviors into tiny bits. Surprisingly,
                                    this is called "splitting". There's no problem correcting a poor dumbbell pickup if
                                    picking it up has been taught in six small stages. Simply identify which of the six
                                    stages has the problem and retrain it the way you want it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So lumping is one major problem in the Criteria department. Another is forgetting
                                    exactly what your criteria was. Sure, you can change your mind about what you want
                                    when you see what you THOUGHT you wanted isn't going to work. And if you don't care
                                    how she holds the dumbbell, that's fine too. But if you DO care and you're clicking
                                    the dog for holding the dumbbell in her molars one day, behind her canines the next
                                    day, and between her incisors the next day, you're not going to get any consistent
                                    behavior from the dog.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When you have a problem – or, preferably BEFORE you have a problem – why not write
                                    down your training splits for each behavior, and exactly what your criteria is for
                                    each small split?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The second problem area to examine is <strong>Rate of Reinforcement</strong>.
                                    Effective trainers give
                                    information to dogs at a rate up to five times faster than less effective trainers.
                                    Sophisticated clicker-trained dogs can work for several minutes at a time with no
                                    further information from their trainers, but even clicker-savvy dogs will quit if
                                    they aren't getting enough reinforcement.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Beginner dogs don't have the stamina of their more advanced sisters and are
                                    frequently labeled "stubborn" or "bored". In reality, these dogs just need more
                                    information. In the first stages of training, a dog should be getting clicked
                                    <strong>
                                        at
                                        LEAST every couple of seconds
                                    </strong>. A dog that can't seem to focus on the training can
                                    frequently be brought back by ten or twenty treats given, one at a time, as fast as
                                    the trainer can hand them over. This is called Rapid-Fire Reinforcement. Sometimes
                                    you can almost hear the dog saying "Oh! THIS is more like it! There IS a reason to
                                    play this game!"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And finally, to solve a problem, look at your <strong>Timing</strong>. If you're
                                    getting behavior
                                    that follows or precedes the behavior you really wanted, you probably aren't hitting
                                    the correct behavior with the click.
                                </p>

                                    Take the Levels as seriously as you want to. If you're looking for suggestions of
                                    new things to teach your dog, that's your choice. If you want to sort of play along,
                                    that's fine too. If you want to use the Levels as a plan for training your dog, I
                                    have some hints about passing the Levels.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you have a friend to help you, or training buddies, ask your buddy to "judge" you
                                    and your dog as you challenge each behavior. That way you'll both get used to
                                    performing in front of other people. If you don't have a friend you can borrow, you
                                    can test the dog yourself on most of the behaviors, especially in the early Levels.
                                    Don't cheat though! The dog will need to be competent in early behaviors to be able
                                    to do well in later ones. For my own dogs, I don't count them passing a behavior
                                    until they can give me that behavior "cold" on a day when we haven't been training
                                    it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    All behaviors in a Level don't have to be passed at one time. Test your dog for each
                                    behavior as he's ready for them. In fact, you can challenge any behavior at any
                                    Level at any time, you don't have to pass all the Level One behaviors before testing
                                    a Level Two behavior. Remember, though, that the purpose of the Levels is to show
                                    you where there might be holes in your training, so if you skip a behavior, be sure
                                    to go back and pick it up before you get too far beyond it in other areas.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Print out a checklist. I printed a list of all the behaviors at each Level with a

                                    Some behaviors are printed in red. These must be tested with no food or clicker (or
                                    toys) on you, on the table, or anywhere in the room, ring, or testing area. Why?
                                    Because nobody wants to spend their entire lives walking around with a pocketful of
                                    dog food. Because you can't take food into trials. No matter what future is in store
                                    for the dog, she needs to perform without the lure of food or treats in front of
                                    her. We have to build faith into her – faith that she WILL be rewarded, whether or
                                    not she can see or smell the reward when she's asked to do the behavior. So the
                                    "red behaviors" start early – in <a href="training-level-two.html">Level 2</a> we're
                                    already asking her for some of that
                                    faith.

                                    Behaviors printed in green are optional. Different trainers have different goals for
                                    their dogs. Some trainers (especially trainers in the early stages of crossing over
                                    from traditional training to clicker training) are leery of teaching a conformation
                                    dog to Sit, or to Watch while moving. A trainer might not want a very young, very
                                    old, or "otherwise enabled" dog to jump, or see any future use for scent
                                    discrimination.

                                <p> At each Level from 3 on, there are optional behaviors. In <a
                                        href="training-level-three.html">Level 3</a>,
                                    there are eight optional behaviors. To pass the Level, the dog must test out four of
                                    them. In Level 4, he must also pass four of the eight optionals. In Level 5, eight
                                    out of eleven.
                                    In Level 6, eight of sixteen, and in Level 7, ten of sixteen must be passed to earn
                                    the Level.
                                    Before you get too far into Level 3, it would be a good idea to read through the
                                    rest of the Levels and mark which optional behaviors you want to work on, as
                                    behaviors at more advanced Levels will usually depend on the foundations you've laid
                                    in earlier Levels. For myself, my dogs and I will be working through ALL the
                                    behaviors in all the Levels – I want them to be as versatile and knowledgeable as
                                    possible.

                                    Get enough people to sit on chairs in a circle so that the circle is closed - that
                                    is, once the dog is in the circle, she can't get out again. A class is a good number
                                    of people to play with. OR you could play with fewer people if you had a corner or
                                    exercise pen panels to block parts of the circle for you. Everyone has good treats,
                                    and the trainer sits in the circle with the other people.

                                    Now, this game is played in two different ways, depending on the wishes of the
                                    trainer on any particular day. The object of the game is to balance the dog. Shy
                                    dogs, stand-offish dogs, and dogs who are reluctant to meet and greet other people
                                    play one way. Bold dogs, gladhanders, and dogs who ignore their trainers to go
                                    visiting play another way.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For shy dogs, everyone but the trainer feeds the dog. Sometimes we have to start
                                    playing the game with everyone averting their eyes and holding out one open hand
                                    with a treat on it. sometimes we have to drop treats on the floor near the dog to
                                    get her started. Her trainer doesn't feed her, but can say hello when she stops by.
                                    The others can call her or not call her, depending on how she's reacting.
                                    Eventually, people can put one hand out so the shy dog has to touch the hand to get
                                    food from the other hand, but no one is trying to catch her. This is a totally
                                    positive experience for the dog and by the second or third time she plays, she
                                    should be clamoring to get into the circle. She's being balanced toward being more
                                    calm, relaxed, and friendly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For the gladhanders, the game is played the opposite way. Everyone has treats, but
                                    no one will give any to the dog. The whole circle plays hand Zen with her except her
                                    trainer. No one will reward her in any way. No one will talk to her, look at her, or
                                    pet her. If she puts her paws up on someone, they'll stand up or turn away. Zero
                                    interaction when she's talking to a person. The OTHER people, however, are all
                                    trying to get her to come to them, calling "Here, doggy, doggy" and "Doggy want a
                                    cookie?" snapping fingers and whistling (don't call her name, please, that's not
                                    fair). But when she gets to them, they totally shut down. Sooner or later, probably
                                    by accident, she arrives back in front of her trainer who gives her five treats in a
                                    row, one at a time, then waves his hands and tells her to "Go on, go play". At this
                                    cue, the others in the circle start calling her again. And pretty soon, the gladdest
                                    hand in the litter won't leave dad for any money! You can also play floor Zen with
                                    everybody putting their foot on a treat.

                                    One of the many things I like about this game is that it convinces the dog that
                                    people may be completely useless without convincing her that people are mean or
                                    scary.

                                    Play this for a few minutes before the start of every weekly class or get-together.
                                    After a few weeks, which game you play will be based on the attitude of the dog on
                                    that particular day, and you'll know, at that point, that the dog is well and truly
                                    balanced.

                                    Being "in the game" is a way of describing the absolute FIRST thing you MUST have
                                    before you train or work your dog in ANY situation. It's the bottom line. I offer,
                                    for instance, two people, each working a dog in agility. One dog isn't sure how to
                                    do weave poles but is paying attention to the situation and trying hard to figure
                                    out what the trainer wants. The other dog knows how to do weave poles perfectly but
                                    keeps wandering off to visit the sidelines. Which dog do I want to be working?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>*I*</strong> want to be working the one that's in the game, even if he
                                    doesn't know anything about what he's supposed to be doing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So many people get hung up in being upset because the dog is "refusing" to do the
                                    weaves, or "blowing off" the weaves, when what they need to do is get back to the
                                    bottom line. The weaves are nothing if the dog isn't in the game.
                                </p>

                                    Right. BUT. How to get a puppy in the game? I know people who start their puppies in
                                    the bathroom, where there are no distractions. No matter where you're working, take
                                    great care to control the opportunities to do anything else. Then set yourself up
                                    for success so that the dog is going to be desperate to work. By this I mean work
                                    when the dog is hungry. Make sure she doesn't have to go outside. Use at the very
                                    least her dinner, better yet, throw in an occasional bit of hot dog or roast. Or,
                                    with a terrier, maybe one time in five or ten, you might hand her a real fur tug toy
                                    and play tug with her for a minute as a reward.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you're working with a hungry pup who's expecting her dinner, and she wanders off
                                    to do something else, you can cancel the whole session and walk away yourself -
                                    taking her meal with you, of course. Then give her nothing until the next scheduled
                                    meal, when you start asking her to work again.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Notice when you're working - is she really attentive for five minutes, then has
                                    trouble? Maybe YOU'RE slowing down your rate of reinforcement. When Stitch was 4
                                    months old, the first few minutes of a meal, she was almost frantic to work, she was
                                    so hungry. During those minutes, she worked much better if I handed her three or
                                    four kibbles instead of one per click. Once her stomach realized it was actually
                                    getting fed, I could slow down and give her less. Other dogs might work for little
                                    to start with and then need more and more to keep them working. If I was working a
                                    dog whose interest grew less as we worked, I'd probably work with the first half of
                                    the meal, then jackpot a really good behavior with the rest of the meal so I'm never
                                    working her when she's lackadaisical.
                                </p>

                                    If "in the game" is what you're thinking of every time, all the time, when you work
                                    the pup, the pup's body and mind will start getting in the game every time you start
                                    working. After awhile, it'll become natural to both of you, but only if you keep it
                                    as the first and most important thing you ever teach the dog. And the more you
                                    practice it, the more natural it becomes.

                                    Honestly, I just grit my teeth when I see people trying to do agility (or anything
                                    else with a dog) with the dog wandering around sniffing and visiting. These people
                                    may have been working agility, but they haven't been working the DOG.

                                    Every time you give your dog a reward for a behavior, you're "banking" the behavior.
                                    Think of putting a penny in a jar every time you give the dog a treat. Call the dog,
                                    she comes, a treat for her and a penny in the jar. She comes 100 times, you've given
                                    her a 100 treats for coming, and you've got 100 pennies in the jar. Let's say that
                                    to your dog, coming is worth a nickel. Every time you call your dog and DON'T give
                                    her a treat, you're spending a nickel out of your "come jar". When you run out of
                                    money in the jar, you don't get the behavior any more. Dogs will work gladly on what
                                    you've banked, but they don't work much on credit.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Each behavior has a different value to each individual dog. To my dog, picking
                                    something up and giving it to me is a cheap behavior. She likes to retrieve, it
                                    makes her feel good, and she'll sell me retrieves 3 for a penny or 50 for a dime.
                                    Going in her crate, though, is an expensive behavior. She's a service dog, she's
                                    supposed to be with me all the time. She's USED to being with me all the time. Going
                                    in a crate and then having to listen to me round up my coat and the car keys is just
                                    plain insulting. Going in a crate is a 50-cent behavior and I BETTER have 50 pennies
                                    in the jar before I ever THINK about putting her in that crate without a treat, or
                                    there's gonna be trouble tomorrow!

                                    Crate Training (teaching the pup to be happy and comfortable in a kennel) is in the
                                    Levels, starting at <a href="training-level-two.html">Level 2</a>. In general, it's
                                    best to go through the behaviors one
                                    Level at a time - that is, teach all the Level 1 behaviors, then move on to Level 2.
                                    This is because there are behaviors in each Level which complement and support each
                                    other so everything you teach supports other things that you're teaching.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The crate, however, is a special circumstance. The purpose of the crate is to keep
                                    the pup secure and the house safe when you can't supervise. Turning a new dog loose
                                    in your house when you're not there (or not watching every second) is like leaving a
                                    toddler loose in your house when you're gone. Or an untrained teenager.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I'd first suggest trying to find an alternative to putting the pup in a crate - the
                                    laundry room, perhaps, or an exercise pen. If that's not possible, please train
                                    rapidly through the Crate behaviors in all the Levels without waiting for the rest
                                    of the behaviors at each Level. <strong>
                                        <em>
                                            Above all, do NOT stuff the puppy in the crate and
                                            let her scream.
                                        </em>
