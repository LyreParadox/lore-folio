                        <h4>Introduction: Simple and Easy aren't Always the Same.</h4>
                        <p>One of the things that appealed
                            to me when I first started exploring clicker training was it's simplicity. I always think
                            about
                            the
                            proverbial elevator speech. How do you describe what you do in the time it takes to go up a
                            couple
                            of floors in an elevator? With some of the things I've studied, I'd need to trap the
                            elevator
                            between floors for a couple of hours to even begin to have someone understand what I was
                            talking
                            about. But clicker training is different. Once you've referenced B.F. Skinner and marine
                            mammal
                            training, people are at least in the right ballpark. They may not really know how the game
                            is
                            played, but at least they have some general idea of what you're talking about. Then you add
                            in
                            the
                            simple mantra: if you like it, you click and reinforce it. There, done. You're on the third
                            floor.
                            You can get off now.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Except that brief description doesn't really tell you very much. Like all good things that
                            are
                            worth
                            studying, simple does not always mean easy. Lets tease apart that opening mantra. If you
                            like
                            it,
                            click and reinforce it. What do you like? What behaviors are you going to train? And what
                            aspect
                            of
                            the behavior are you going to click? It can sound so easy. I want my horse to back so I'll
                            click
                            every time he takes a step back. That should work. The left front foot lifts up slightly -
                            I'll
                            click that. The right front lifts slightly - click again. The left front picks up and then
                            sets
                            down
                            again. Click that. The left front lifts forward to paw just before the horse shifts his
                            weight
                            back.
                            Click. Four clicks for four very different behaviors. Some horses can handle this. Others
                            can't.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Go play the training game and find out what kind of "horse" you'd be. Would you go with the
                            flow
                            and
                            figure out the answer in spite of your trainer's handling errors? Or would you be the
                            "horse"
                            who
                            becomes frustrated and confused when the criteria are not clear? Is it any wonder some of
                            our
                            horses
                            become confused? It sounded so easy, just click when your horse backs, but your horse's
                            behavior
                            may
                            be telling you need to look a bit deeper into the equation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So behavior - what does that mean? Are you selecting a single component out of a larger
                            behavior, or
                            are you focused too much on the end goal? And what are your goals? What do you want to
                            teach?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And click - when, how often, for what? Reinforce - how often, with what?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lots of questions pop out of even the simplest of equations. So let's look at some of the
                            things
                            that make simple also easy. I'll do this by looking at the characteristics that good clicker
                            trainers have in common.

                <h4 class="card-title">Ten Characteristics of Good Clicker Trainers: Part 1</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Clicker trainers, regardless of the species they are working with, love their
                        animals.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Now note: you can use clicker training as a procedural tool and have a very sterile view
                    of
                    animals.
                    There are trainers who choose to use the techniques of clicker training because they are
                    the
                    most
                    effective and efficient training method they have found. But they view the animals they
                    work
                    with as
                    little more than tools. When I talk about someone being a clicker trainer, this is not
                    what
                    I
                    mean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also love animals deeply and not be a clicker trainer. We don't have a monopoly
                    on
                    that
                    particular claim. There are wonderful horse people out there who have no intention of
                    ever
                    giving
                    clicker training a try, but who deeply love their horses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within the clicker community we can have different ideas about how a particular lesson
                    should be
                    trained, but those differences melt away in the face of our common love of horses. That
                    deep
                    caring
                    for our horses and our concern for their welfare brings us head on into a collision with
                    the
                    first
                    puzzle clicker training presents: what do we train?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clicker training is incredibly powerful. We can easily teach horses behaviors that they
                    would
                    not on
                    their own ever undertake. So the training mantra for this is: <em>
                        Just because you can doesn't mean you
                        should.
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, just because you can use the clicker to teach your horse to jump, doesn't
                    necessarily
                    mean you should. Your horse may have soundness or conformational issues that make
                    jumping
                    problematic. Or he may simply be too young. I bought my young horse, Robin from a man
                    who
                    trained
                    grand prix level jumpers. Robin was only a year old at the time, but the trainer still
                    sent
                    him
                    at
                    liberty over a full jump course. The jumps were high and the turns were tight. No horse
                    Robin's
                    age
                    should have been jumping anything like this course, but that's how this trainer tested
                    all
                    the
                    horses who came into his barn. I could hardly wait to get Robin's young legs out of
                    there.
                    Just
                    because you can doesn't mean you should.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Robin loved jumping. I think he was disappointed that the game didn't continue in his
                    new
                    home.
                    He
                    even showed me how much he enjoyed jumping by springing over the paddock fence to come
                    greet
                    me
                    every time I arrived at the barn! It would have been so easy to let him have his fun,
                    but he
                    had
                    to
                    wait a couple of years before jumping was officially reintroduced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So even with some of the most common things people teach we need to be asking the
                    "should
                    we"
                    question. Should we be asking our young horse to jump, our older horse to canter at
                    speed,
                    our
                    arthritic horse to travel in a trailer, etc.? The answer to these questions isn't always
                    easy.
                    What
                    we want and what our horses need don't always match up. Loving a horse can sometimes
                    mean
                    giving
                    up
                    what we thought were our goals. The good news is with clicker training what we can train
                    often
                    ends
                    up being so much more fun than what we originally set out to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And very often when we tease a lesson apart into the small steps that are part of good
                    clicker
                    training we find ourselves not just back at our original goal, but surpassing it. Small
                    steps
                    shrink
                    big ones into behaviors our horses can safely and easily handle.

                <ol>
                    <li>Clicker trainers, regardless of the species they are working with, love their
                        animals.
                    </li>
                    <li>Clicker trainers focus on what they want, not the unwanted behavior. </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="card-text">Clicker trainers are non-reactive to behavior they do not want. That
                    doesn't mean that they ignore bad behavior, but they don't add "fuel to the fire" by
                    responding directly to it. When you focus on WHAT YOU WANT, you get more of that good
                    behavior. Let your attention wander so all you can see is what you don't like, and
                    you'll
                    find yourself in a training muddle. You'll also find a horse who is at risk of losing
                    the
                    safety net of a secure home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what do we train? If you love your horse, there's an easy first answer - good
                    manners. We
                    need to feel safe around our horses. Horses who are scary or just plain pushy are not
                    fun to
                    be around. As much as we may love them, unsafe behavior can begin to unravel any horse's
                    safety net. So our love for our horses leads us straight to the beginning steps of
                    clicker
                    training - teaching the good manners a horse needs to get along with his human partners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trick here is not to fall back into the trap of focusing on unwanted behavior. It's
                    all
                    too easy to find yourself saying: "I don't want my horse looking like an evil grump.
                    He's
                    always pinning his ears and crowding into me." Instead I want to define clearly what
                    kinds
                    of behavior I enjoy being around. That's what I'll focus on, and that's what I'll
                    reinforce.
                    Easy!

                </ol>
                <p class="card-text">Clicker trainers know that not every lesson works for every learner.
                    Here
                    the mantra is: There is ALWAYS more than one way to train every behavior. If one shaping
                    method isn't working, change what you're doing. I've heard people say that they tried
                    clicker training and it didn't work with their horse. This always makes me feel sad. I
                    know
                    what a wonderfully good time both the horse and the handler are missing out on. And I
                    also
                    know that they didn't really try clicker training. They may have tried one or two things
                    and
                    then got in a muddle, but that doesn't mean clicker training doesn't work. Normally it
                    means
                    they need to tidy up their basic handling. Maybe the timing of the click was off or
                    their
                    treat delivery was inconsistent. Once people get themselves sorted, horses generally
                    respond
                    really fast.</p>
                <p>
                    I'll occasionally get into a muddle with a horse. The lesson that normally works so well
                    with other horses isn't making sense to this particular horse. When that happens, I
                    don't
                    abandon clicker training. Instead I go have the proverbial cup of tea while I think out
                    a
                    better way to explain things to my horse. Sometimes I need to break the lesson down into
                    smaller steps. Sometimes I need to change the environment. Sometimes I need to change my
                    teaching strategy altogether. Maybe I was trying to free shape the exercise but this
                    horse
                    needs more guidance. Okay, I can do that with a target or a lead rope. I can set out
                    some
                    mats or maybe ground poles will help. Whatever the answer, clicker training encourages
                    creativity.

                    Have you ever played the game where everyone in the group takes a turn naming a breed of
                    horse? You keep going around the circle until one by one people can't come up with an
                    answer, and they have to drop out. How many rounds would you last before you'd exhaust
                    your
                    list? Now think about the same game but this time think of all the different ways you
                    can
                    come up with to teach a horse to lower his head, or pick up his feet, or - most
                    interesting
                    of all - go in a trailer. Do you run out of ideas in just the first round, or would you
                    still be coming up with ideas after everyone else has dropped out. Give yourself that
                    mental
                    challenge. It was the Red Queen from Lewis Carroll's "Through the Looking Glass" who
                    gets
                    the credit for saying she likes to think about six impossible things before breakfast.
                    Instead of six impossible things, can you come up with six new ways to train an old
                    behavior. The more you exercise this skill, the better you'll become at it.

                <p class="card-text">If WHAT we choose to click matters, then just as important is WHO we
                    click.
                    Clicker trainers know that they need to structure their training to meet the learning
                    needs
                    of each individual horse. It helps to pick a horse who is a match with your own training
                    style. If you enjoy easy, pick easy. Easy horses give you time to think. They are
                    forgiving
                    and will fill in for you if you make a handling error. If you want a challenge, consider

                    ride
                    this horse will take you on?</p>
                <p>
                    At a recent clinic one of the participants had several mustangs. Her oldest is a 13 year
                    old
                    stallion who was "gathered" when he was five. When he was captured, there was a
                    miscommunication between the company who caught him and the company who were supposed to
                    transport him. His herd was left behind in the holding pens for two weeks with little
                    food
                    or water. Many of the horses died. He was one of the few survivors. He was passed around
                    from one horse rescue to another before my client finally adopted him as an essentially
                    untouched and rightfully fearful ten year old. To say that he was complicated would be
                    the
                    understatement of the year. He is a deeply troubled, emotionally damaged horse. You
                    can't
                    start with him at the same point where most other horses begin. He forces you to be
                    creative, patient and above all persistent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His new person is more than up for the challenge. She's an experienced clicker trainer
                    with
                    a broad understanding of learning theory. She's both creative and persistent. And she
                    has
                    other horses which gives her a better understanding of this horse's unique learning
                    challenges. Difficult horses take you on a journey of discovery. If you find yourself
                    with
                    one of these horses already living in your barn, you are in for quite an adventure. They
                    are
                    the best teacher you will ever have! If you're still looking for the perfect equine
                    partner,
                    consider well what sort of emotional journey you want to go on.

                </ol>
                <p class="card-text">When I am working with horses like the mustang I described in the
                    previous
                    section, or a stallion who has become angry because of aggressive handling, one of the
                    mantras that I keep repeating is "it's not your fault." When I slide up the lead to ask
                    a
                    troubled stallion to take a step back out of my space, I want to take all the
                    make-it-happen
                    force out of my body. He should feel only a quiet asking, not a command. Reminding
                    myself
                    that there are reasons for a horse's anger and mistrust helps me to be non-reactive.
                    When
                    you are working with emotionally complex horses, you need to pay incredible attention to
                    detail.</p>
                <p>
                    The expression, "It's not your fault", comes from the book "A Long Way Gone" by Ismael
                    Beah.
                    Beah was a child soldier in Sierra Leone. He didn't just witness the atrocities of war.
                    He
                    committed them. When he was pulled out of the army and sent to a rehab center, he and
                    the
                    other child soldiers at the facility would lash out at their caregivers. The adults
                    never
                    retaliated by punishing the behavior. Instead they would remain non-reactive and repeat
                    over
                    and over to the boys: "It's not your fault. It's not your fault." At first this enraged
                    Ismael even more. How could it not be his fault - he had done terrible things. But
                    gradually
                    their kindness broke through to him, and he was able to move on from his nightmare years
                    as
                    a child soldier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This part of his story reminded me so of some of the horses I encounter. They have so
                    much
                    rage inside them, so much to say about how they have been treated. I don't want to
                    suppress
                    that rage through the use of punishment. Instead I remind myself that it is not their
                    fault.
                    I am not ignoring their terrible behavior. Instead I remain as non-reactive to it as I
                    can.
                    In clicker training we begin by managing the environment well, so we do not have to
                    manage
                    behavior through force and intimidation. That means we have to become very good with the
                    details of training.

                <p class="card-text">In Part 5 I talked about the challenges that emotionally complex horses
                    pose for their handlers. For these horses attention to details becomes essential. Not
                    all
                    horses confront us with such puzzles. Some, like Panda, the mini I trained to be a guide
                    for
                    the blind, are straight forward, and super easy to get along with.</p>
                <p>
                    I often say with horses like Panda you can skip the first two thirds of every training
                    book
                    - the parts that deal with emotional issues - and go straight to the fun stuff. If Panda
                    had
                    simply been a family pet, her training would have been very easy indeed. But Panda isn't
                    a
                    family pet. She's a working guide for her blind owner. Her training was complex because
                    she
                    is doing a complex job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having said that, training Panda to be a guide was not hard. All the tasks she performs
                    can
                    be broken down into simple steps. The key to her training was consistency. I knew there
                    would never be a time when her blind handler would be able to see a curb or a partially
                    open
                    door. If Panda was going to be consistent in her job, I had to be consistent in her
                    training. That meant that each and every time we came to a curb crossing or an open
                    doorway
                    we stopped. If I was running late and needed to dash into the post office before it
                    closed,
                    that didn't matter. Being consistent meant we couldn't cut across the parking lot. We
                    had to
                    track the edge just as a blind handler would. It might take longer, but I had to take
                    the
                    same route a blind handler would use.

                <p class="card-text">Good trainers are splitters not lumpers. That's true whether they use
                    clicker training or other more conventional methods. Good trainers break lessons down
                    into
                    many small steps and they take the time to fill in all the pieces. Lumpers lump. They
                    ask
                    for too much, too fast. That can be hard on a learner, especially when being wrong means
                    you're in trouble. In clicker training we make sure that the learner feels safe. It's
                    okay
                    to experiment and make mistakes. And if a lesson begins to be too hard, we break it down
                    into smaller, more manageable units. The result are clicker superstars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of our clicker superstars was an appaloosa named Crackers. Crackers belonged to one
                    of
                    my long term clients, Bob Viviano. They were two of our very early clicker pioneers. I
                    began
                    working with Bob originally because Crackers used to rush over fences. We began with
                    foundation work. That included basic targeting which grew into fetching which grew into
                    so
                    much more. Bob taught Crackers a huge repertoire of target-related tricks. And then he
                    began
                    sharing Crackers with others. Crackers was a regular visitor to the Hole in the Wall
                    Camp
                    for children with cancer. He visited nursing homes and at Christmas he rang the bell for
                    the
                    Salvation Army.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Target-based tricks are easy to teach. Getting Crackers to open a mailbox, pull out a
                    newspaper and hand it over to us was the work of an afternoon. That part was easy. The
                    complex part of the training was filling in all the basic handling steps that would let
                    Bob
                    "take the show on the road". Crackers had to be just as comfortable handing a small
                    child in
                    a wheel chair the newspaper as he was for any of us. And he had to do it in the parking
                    lot
                    of a busy shopping mall at Christmas time, or at the county fair with kites and hot air
                    balloons flying over his head. Because Bob took the time to fill in all the training
                    steps,
                    he was able to share Crackers with thousands of people.

                <p class="card-text">Clicker trainers break their training down into many small steps. This
                    isn't something I learned from books or from other people. My horses taught it to me. I
                    learned early on that <em>
                        no matter how small a step may seem, there is ALWAYS a smaller step
                        that a lesson can be broken down into
                    </em>. Clicker training is about finding those tiny "yes
                    answers." What CAN you ask your horse to do so you can get a consistent yes answer? With
                    the
                    fearful mustang stallion I wrote about in Part 4 his owner had to begin at a distance
                    looking for even the smallest hint that he could relax in her presence. That means that
                    clicker trainers are also good observers. They have learned to look for small details in
                    behavior.</p>
                <p>
                    In my world all roads lead to balance. If I am looking at small detail, I will be
                    looking at
                    very subtle shifts of balance. This is the raw material I use to shape great behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These days everyone talks about harmony, relationship, balance. They are such commonly
                    used
                    terms, they can easily lose their meaning. For me when I think of horses and balance, I
                    also
                    think of ballet. And here again is a word that can easily trigger the wrong images and
                    negative emotional responses. If you were marched off to ballet class at an early age
                    when
                    what you really wanted to do was ride your pony, you may have anything but a positive
                    reaction to that word. Thankfully, I was spared that. Instead I got to watch some of the
                    world's best dancers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was often joined on those evenings at the ballet by a friend who had brittle bone
                    disease.
                    Those dancers freed her from the confines of her wheel chair. She couldn't walk, but
                    through
                    her imagination she could dance. We would sit together spellbound watching the
                    impossible
                    beauty of Suzanne Farrell and Mikhail Baryshnikov performing together in a Balanchine
                    ballet. When I talk about balance in horses, it is their artistry that has helped inform
                    my
                    eye.

                <p class="card-text">All too often we let our own biases be the only source for our feelings
                    about a subject. I often use the word "play" when I talk about training. I'll tell
                    someone
                    to go "play" with an exercise. I remember years ago one of my clients telling me that
                    when I
                    told her to go "play" with an idea, that was a shut down for her. As a toddler learning
                    to
                    draw, she wanted to color all over the page. But her mother made her stay within the
                    lines
                    when she was given a coloring book. Play was a poisoned word. But play is such a
                    commonly
                    used word. For most of us it has happy associations. When your response to something is
                    a
                    little off, you need to recognize this and instead search for the meaning others have
                    found
                    in an expression. Sometimes you will find you were right to go your own way. Other times
                    seeing the world through a different lens opens doors you didn't even know existed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking at the world through a new lens sometimes results in reshaping our ideas about
                    training procedures. Early on in my clicker training experience I went to a conference
                    sponsored by the Association of Pet Dog Trainers. This was almost twenty years ago now
                    and
                    things have changed dramatically in the dog world. But even at that time I was impressed
                    by
                    how much positive dog training I was seeing. There were, however, two very distinct
                    types of
                    training going on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were people using food as a lure with no marker signal, and others who were using
                    marker signals followed by a food reward. There was a definite difference in the dogs.
                    The
                    lured dogs were focused entirely on the food. They may have been moving but they were
                    completely unaware of what their feet were doing. In contrast the clicker trained dogs
                    were
                    very aware of what they were doing. Seeing the contrast I joined the growing group of
                    "clicker purists" who considered luring as the lesser cousin. This bias persisted for
                    many
                    years until I watched Kay Laurence training dogs. Kay makes elegant use of food lures.
                    As
                    she would say, don't discard a training technique just because you have seen it badly
                    applied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Play lets you turn a lesson upside down and inside out. It lets you pull it apart so you
                    can
                    find all the components hidden inside. Now think of all the different ways you could
                    teach
                    those components. How are you going to break down every segment of that lesson so your
                    horse
                    doesn't simply understand what is wanted, he's eager to play?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The more you play with ideas and the more you play with your horse, the more you will
                    discover the new landscapes that have always been right in front of you.

                    to
                    come together with other positively-focused people for an exchange of ideas. Clicker
                    trainers are interesting people. We are both rule breakers and rule followers. We broke
                    with
                    the rule of you must never feed treats to horses. But we follow the "rules" of good
                    learning
                    theory. Those rules are easy to find. Our horses show them to us with every interaction.
                    Clicker training has given our horses a voice that can be heard. So here's one last
                    unifying
                    characteristic of clicker trainers - we are good listeners.
